The theme applies Material Design principles and Material Theming to your site, so you can customize its style. Example layouts include pages for home, about, projects, blog, and contact.

Set up and preview your global theme styles within the customizer. Choose colors, typography, shapes, and icons to express your unique style.

=== Build with Material Blocks ===

Implement your colors, shapes, and typography for built-in WordPress elements like your site’s header and footer.
